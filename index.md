### Project#6
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to code classes that inherit some of their functionality from a base class. The base class is called Shape and it creates an empty array of sides for all shapes as well as sets their starting perimeter to zero until test input is given. The first class to inherit from Shape is Rectangle which creates a rectangle by processing it's length and with as sides thanks to it's inheritance and calculates it's area. The other class to inherit from Shape is Triangle which does the same things as the rectangle class but for Triangles instead.
